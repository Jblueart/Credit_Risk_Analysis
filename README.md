# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Machine Based Learning and Credit Risk Analysis
Before even starting the analysis we must clean and read the data

Drop Null rows & convert some rows, look at the top few rows to be sure everything is lining up and the data was parsed correctly.

## Create a machine learning model to Predict Credit Risk
Method: Using several Machine Learning models, I'll analyze the LoanStats_2019Q1 dataset

The Classification report contains the Precision, Recall, f1-score, geo, iba, Support, 
Precision, or accuracy. F1-Score or Harmonic Mean = 2(Precision * Sensitivity)/(Precision + Sensitivity)
The tension between precision and sensitivity is important. High sensitive algorithyms are aggressive but risk more false positives. High Precision is more conservative so that predicted positives are true positives, but you may miss other positives. One must be mindful of balancing the two based on the scenerio. 
An imbalance will yield a low F1 score. 

### Resampling Model Predictions
OverSampling: 63% accuracy

Smote OverSampling: 63% accuracy

UnderSampling: 52% accuraccy not so great

### SMOTEENN Algorithm Predictions
Combination, Over & Under, Sampling: 65% accuracy

### Ensemble Classifiers to predict

At the moment I'm struggling with the Ensemble classifiers and getting an attribute error. I'm going to take a break on them to focus on the final group project instead. 





## Results: 
When looking at the the resampling methods the SMOTEENN algorithm had the highest accuracy but it wasn't by a huge margin. Undersampling wasn't nearly as successful as the others and was nearly the same odds as flipping a coin to determine credit worthiness. I would hope no financial institutions would use that method. 

## Summary

Machine Learning has it's quirks and place but it is complex and confusing to me. In the end I don't think it's going to be 100 percent perfect, but in actuality sometimes we don't need perfect results.
